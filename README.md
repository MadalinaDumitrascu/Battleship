### BattleShip OOP  
One of the reasons microcomputers progressed so fast is people are willing to accept crashes. It's faster to build something and try it, even if it means you'll have to rebuild later... If you spent too much time building and massaging one vehicle, you don't learn anything.

John Carmack,
lead programmer of Doom (and more)

In this project your job was to implement the Battleship game for two players and use the newly learned OOP practices.



OOP - TARGET!!!

Gain good understanding of the OOP principles and implement them in your code.

The program does not use static contexts.

Classes are grouped in namespaces.

Classes have fields, methods, and properties that are related only to them

Classes have access modifiers that expose their content as little as possible.

Properties with private setters are used instead of fields wherever possible.

Classes are logically structured and inherit from parents to eliminate code duplication.

Classes use public methods to communicate with outside code, and private methods to eliminate code duplication and improve readability.

Polymorphism is used wherever possible, to make the code as universal as possible and to avoid code duplication.

What are you going to learn?

UML diagrams

clean code

encapsulation

abstraction

polymorphism

inheritance

enums

S and O principles from SOLID

namespaces in C#

properties and get-only properties in C#
